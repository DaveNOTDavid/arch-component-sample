# Android Architecture Component Sample Project
A sample project attempting to use the latest and greatest Android tech. The code is divided into branches starting with [dev-arch-1](https://github.com/DaveNOTDavid/arch-component-sample/tree/dev-arch-1) with the main differences between that branch and say, [dev-arch-2](https://github.com/DaveNOTDavid/arch-component-sample/tree/dev-arch-2) being the reactive and DI approaches with base technologies like MVVM, HTTP client interface setup, Room DB, unit testing with Mockito, and etc.  

TODO: This branch will focus on getting started with Jetpack Compose by refactoring this project to use Composable functions for starters

Note that the app is getting its data from [News API](https://newsapi.org).
